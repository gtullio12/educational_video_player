# Education Video Player

## Solution
Basic video player with sample videos. The website has three main pages, the `Home` component, `SearchVideos` component and the `View`(which displays the video selected from either `Home` or `SearchVideos`). The user garret_tullio is hardcoded into the frontend. For the search page, the search will show any videos based off of title of video, as long as the search content is a substring of the video title it will show up on the search page.  \
The sample videos were taken from [here](https://gist.github.com/deepakpk009/99fd994da714996b296f11c3c371d5ee)
